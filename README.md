# Localization-algorithm-using-Camera-and-LIDAR
Project: Developed an algorithm for Localization using camera and LiDAR
• Structured algorithms for vehicle localization that improved simulation accuracy by 20% using camera and LiDAR.
• Simulated and validated a localization algorithm using ROS/Gazebo, achieving greater than 90% positional accuracy in real-time scenarios
